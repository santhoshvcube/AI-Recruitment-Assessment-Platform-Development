- **Password Hashing**: Continue to use strong, industry-standard password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for all user passwords, including the initial mobile number password for students.
- **JWT Tokens**: Generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) upon successful authentication, with claims that include user roles (`student`, `admin`) to facilitate role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement middleware or decorators to protect API routes, ensuring that only authorized users (students or admins) can access specific resources or perform certain actions.
- **Data Validation**: Implement robust validation for email addresses and mobile numbers during registration and login processes.

#### Frontend (Next.js/React)

- **Login Interface**: Design and implement a new login page that clearly distinguishes between student and admin login options. This could involve separate forms or a toggle switch.
- **Student Onboarding**: Develop a flow for students to change their initial mobile number password upon their first successful login.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically render UI components and navigation elements based on the authenticated user's role (student or admin).
- **API Integration**: Update frontend API calls to interact with the new student and admin authentication endpoints.
- **State Management**: Manage user authentication state (e.g., JWT token, user role) securely using context API or a state management library.

### Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data, especially mobile numbers used as initial passwords, are encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- **Session Management**: Secure session management practices, including token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent injection attacks by sanitizing all user inputs.
- **Auditing**: Log all authentication attempts and critical actions for auditing and security monitoring purposes.

### Impact on Existing Features

- **Resume Upload**: Only admin users will be able to upload resumes and job descriptions.
